# Example Heap Snapshot

This is a placeholder for a sample heap snapshot file that users can use to test the heap analyzer functionality.

In a real implementation, this would be a `.heapsnapshot` file exported from Chrome DevTools.

## How to generate a real heap snapshot:

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Memory tab
3. Select "Heap snapshot"
4. Click "Take snapshot"
5. Export/save the snapshot file
6. Place it in your project's heap-snapshots directory

The file format is typically JSON-based with heap data structures.
